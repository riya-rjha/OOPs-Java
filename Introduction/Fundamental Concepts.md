# Introduction to Classes, Objects, Constructors and Keywords

## Classes

- Class is a blueprint of an object.
- It is not a real world entity.
- It is a template of an object, and a logical unit.
- Creation of classes does not occupy space.
- Class is a named group of properties and functions

## Objects

- Object is an instance of class.
- An object is a real world entity.
- Object is a physical unti and creation of objects occupies space.

### Parts of Objects

An object consists of 3 parts: *State*, *Identity* & *Behaviour*.

1. The state of an object is the value from it's data type.
2. The identity of an object is an information of where is it present, heap memory or stack memory.
3. The behaviour of an object is the effect of the methods, or data type operations. 

## Variables

An operation on an object links a reference variable. For eg. If an object std of class Student is defined, it is stored in the stack memory. It creates a referential variable in the heap memory of the attributes & their values. In simpler words, variable that defines and object is called a **Referential Variable**.

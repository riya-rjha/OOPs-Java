# Abstraction

- Abstraction is defined as hiding the unecessary details and showing only the valuable and relevant information. 

- For eg. When we start a car, we focus on inserting keys and driving. We are unaware of the internal combustion process of IC Engines or whatever goes on internally in car. This is Abstraction.

- For eg. We know the working of *println*, but we do not know how Java is configuring the method internally.

- The main difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation is that abstraction solves the design level issue, which we are able to see whereas Encapsulation solves the implementation level issue because that is what is handled by it.

- Abstraction works on the external visible methods, whereas Encapsulation works on the internal methods.

- We use Abstract classes, interfaces in Abstraction, and these define the structure of the program. We need not dive deep in how they are made and what is their definition.
